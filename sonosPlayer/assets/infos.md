SonosPlayer gives you the power to control your Sonos system and all your Sonos music with your voice.

    <img src="../../core/plugins/sonosPlayer/documentation/img/allPlayers.png" alt="sonosPlayer" style="width: 100px; margin-right: 15px;">
    <p style="margin: 0;">SonosPlayer supports all Sonos players, soundbars, and Sonos Roam as well as your 5.1 system (soundbar, Sub, and 2 players)</p>

It also allows you to redirect A.V.A.T.A.R's voice messages and all sounds played by the plugins to the Sonos clients.
