    <p style="margin: 0;">SonosPlayer supports all Sonos players, soundbars, and Sonos Roam as well as your 5.1 system (soundbar, Sub, and 2 players)</p>

It also allows you to redirect A.V.A.T.A.R's voice messages and all sounds played by the plugins to the Sonos clients.

This plugin is an add-on for the [A.V.A.T.A.R](https://avatar-home-automation.github.io/docs) framework. 

## Multi-room

The `sonosPlayer` plugin is fully multi-room; it automatically links A.V.A.T.A.R clients with the Sonos rooms.

## Multi-language

The `sonosPlayer` plugin relies solely on the system's available languages.
